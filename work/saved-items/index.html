                <h1>Saved Items</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The My Account section of the BYU Library website had recently been redesigned, but the Bookmarks page within My Account had not been updated as part of the redesign. I was asked to make the Bookmarks page match the rest of the new My Account interface while also finding ways to improve the Bookmarks system.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I quickly found that many things within the Bookmarks system could be improved upon. As I noticed these things, I began researching how to improve them. I looked up how data categorization and tagging works in other systems. I researched design best practices to understand why I should design components a certain way. As the project evolved, I experimented with several apps and websites such as Amazon, Apple Music, and Instagram to see how saving and categorizing items should work. I wanted to create interactions that users would be familiar with. After doing research, I was ready to start ideating.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I created several versions of sketches of how to improve the usability of Bookmarks. I received and implemented feedback on the sketches which helped refine the workflow of the improved system I was imagining.</p>
                <p>As I showed my sketches to the team and as we brainstormed, we realized that "bookmarks" may have not been the right word for the system. We decided to change the name from Bookmarks to Saved Items. This new approach to the system helped me better understand its core function. We also thought that the new name would help our users instinctively know the purpose of the system. This also led to new ideas and new sketches. The new ideas moved away from Bookmarks for saving and labels for categorization to Saved Items for saving and lists for categorization.</p>

                <p>The new direction of the project helped us find a better solution for the system. After having picked the best sketch I had come up with, I started building a medium-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD.</p>
                <p>Once the prototype was finished, I prepped for a user test. I adapted a user testing protocol from Rocket Surgery Made Easy by Steve Krug, and I wrote the user tasks. I ran the user test with five participants. I received valuable feedback from the test. I found validation that the design I had made was useful and easy to use. I also found several things that I could improve about the design.</p>

                <p>After validating the medium-fidelity prototype with users, I started working on the high-fidelity version of the prototype. This involved refining the design as a whole as well as implementing feedback I received along the way. Throughout the last few weeks of the project, I received feedback from my team several times and I also received feedback from the developers. All of this feedback was helpful to me to find the right solutions to pieces of the design that needed to be improved.</p>
